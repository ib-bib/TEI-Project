# TEI-Project

A website built as a project submission for a University course on "Human Computer Interaction"

This course focuses on basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP as introductory technologies to web development, as well as UI/UX theory in design and accessability.

This repository hosts the combined work of myself and two fellow classmates, where we kept the course's main outlines in mind and did our best to implement them in some way or another.

We would like to extend a special thank you to @ForEvolve and all those who contributed to the @ForEvolve/bootstrap-dark repository, as it was a central tenant of our project.
